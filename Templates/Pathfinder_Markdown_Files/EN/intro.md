The EMPIT Pathfinder App is used to interactively access CMI inspection data. 

The information displayed on the map can be selected using the filter elements below. By clicking on an icon in the map, a pop-up window with additional information appears as well as two graphics below the map.

If location services are activated, this app can also show the user's own position and thus help with orientation in the field.
