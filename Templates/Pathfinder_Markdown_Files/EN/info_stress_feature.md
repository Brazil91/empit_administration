By dragging the slider, the streets are filtered for condition rating. The measure of condition rating used is the probability of failure in predicted damage per meter over the next 10 years. The condition rating of the roadway is based on the aggregate condition rating of the inspection sections.

Categorization of failure probability:
- Green: ≤ 2 ‰/m predicted damage per meter in the next 10 years.
- Yellow: > 2 and ≤ 4‰ predicted damage per meter in the next 10 years
- Red: > 4‰ predicted damage per meter in the next 10 years
