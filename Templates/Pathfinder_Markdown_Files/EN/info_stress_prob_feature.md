Drag the slider to filter the highlighted sections of the pipeline for condition verification safety:
- Barely meaningful: < 60 %
- Conditionally meaningful: 60-80 %
- Meaningful: > 80 %

The value results from a quotient between the inspected pipeline length and the total length of the pipeline. Verifications and faults influence this value.
